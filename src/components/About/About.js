            <p>Web developer between 2000 and 2005 that is returning to business. I have passed the last 12 months searching a developerâ€™s school and bringing me up to level, studying alone. But as much as I was advancing and as much I was discovering all the new possibilities I was getting more and more pationated and wanted to try all the new features.</p>
            <p>I have been working a lot on javaScript, client and server side, and on the React.js framework. Moreover I have worked a lot on the responsive web design, trying to build a solid understanding of the mobile first way of thinking and I have worked a bit with php building a website in php and mySQL.</p>
            <p>I had also the opportunity to work on the apache administration and on SQL and plpgsql with postgreSQL, taking this two courses on CNAM. I have used all the resources out there including openclassrooms, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, countless youtube channels and so on.</p>
            <p>In my life I have tried many and different things and I have worked with a lot of people. Adaptation has become my second nature and working hard and always learning and improving have become my most important values.</p>
            <p>I will be looking for a traineeship (stage) at the end of my courses at Eni in Nantes for the months of april and may 2021 and I will be available for a contract of web developer on june 2021.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading!!</p>
